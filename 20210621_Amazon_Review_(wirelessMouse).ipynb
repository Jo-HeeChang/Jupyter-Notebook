I got  because my baby can hear a pin drop and she doesn't wake up when I click. it sometimes need an easy shake when in sleep mode but I don't think that's as issue. you'll know when it needs a new battery. it takes one AA battery.

      "review :  Perfect for the budget-conscious, no-frills user.  I'm not a gamer.  I use my computer for work, email and surfing the web.  When I saw the gazillion items that came up when I searched \"wireless mouse\", I just took a deep sigh. So many different shapes and colors and \"frills\"(?)  I thought \"Listen, I just want a frickin wireless mouse that works, that isn't annoying.\"  This little number is sleek, simplistically attractive, the wheel is great, the piece that plugs into the usb port is small enough where you can leave it in all the time and there's a great storage place in the mouse for it too. (which may be pretty standard for any wireless mouse, who  knows. I don't.) And it's CHEAP! This mouse is perfect for me and I'd recommend it to anyone. And I'd buy it again. date: \n",

      "review :  I have never heard of sleep mode on a mouse.  There is this website called Amazon which sells AAA batteries by the dozens for like $2.  Instead i'm switching a switch every 5 minutes.The button has a sweet spot.  You think you're going to highlight a paragraph, nope, just part of it.  Then you send a horrible email.  You meant to say something nice and then get to the point, nope you just send the part about how they suck at every aspect of life.....you mean to say you're trying and I hope all is well, but no, the button on the mouse does not work so you're gonna remember that for life.Gotta love breakups.And it's not tiny either like the keywords are, this thing is a big mouse.  A nice mouse is about 2 fingers....this mouse is easily 3-4 finger, this might be a fist. date: \n",

Just having it plugged in for about 15 days for my laptop and it stopped tracking on screen. Now the USB gives an error if you plug it in 'Driver not installed correctly' - why it needs to reinstall the driver I have no clue. Also, even before it quit it wouldn't register when my computer was turned on. I would have to turn it off and turn it back on every time I sat down. My logitech/microsoft mice never needed that.

      "review :  Bought this mouse via Prime May 28 2019. In early January 2020 the center scroll rubber \"button\" on the mouse just stopped working. It will not budge forward or backward; it simply will not work. I did try to \"unstick\" it but when I did, it still did not work. It went right back to being stuck and immovable.Up to now, I've liked the mouse, but really in the long run it's simply not worth it to pay for a mouse that will break after only SEVEN months usage. The right and left buttons still work but have you tried using a mouse without the scroll function? Yeah, not something one wants to do these days.Sorry, cannot recommend this Jelly Comb mouse. It looks nice, it has a sleek design, but it needs to be functional for more than seven months. date: \n",
