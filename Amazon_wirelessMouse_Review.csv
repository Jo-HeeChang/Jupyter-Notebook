   Like other reviewers, I liked this mouse for the first month--it was quiet and worked as it should. However, four weeks in and the ball for scrolling squeaks non-stop with use. There isn't any way to make it stop short of a hammer, which trust me, is coming. Of course it is just past the return date, so I get to simply wave goodbye to my money.",Doc,"September 22, 2017"

   Got a surprise when opened the box. Nice feeling of touch. Very quiet in use. light and smooth. Hope it works well with battery",Sigrid Koo,"March 19, 2019"
5,"For the price this mouse is quite good. The top is soft touch material, and the buttons have very quiet click sounds. I also like that the mouse goes to sleep when not in use, and you need to click to wake it. That way accidental table bumps or cats jumping on your desk won't wake your PC.About the only thing I was disappointed in was the wheel. Being a ball, I thought it freely rotated in all directions for side scrolling. It's actually just a wheel for vertical scrolling, though it works just fine. I won't take a star away because it's such a bargain, but be aware it's not actually a ball!====UPDATE====It's been almost a year, and the mouse still performs as it should. It doesn't even seem to go through the battery very fast.",MonkeyPaw,"March 21, 2017"
5,"Great wireless mouse. I love that it has an on/off switch on the bottom for easy transport. The little usb transmitter also tucks away on the underside for secure storage. This is not a tiny wireless mouse, it is more of a compact full size mouse. It’s comfortable and not too big/small. It takes a single AA battery, not included.This mouse has solid wireless capabilities. I have a laptop in a cabinet with a monitor on top and can use this mouse to control my security software from at least 12’ away. I can use it on a smooth wood surface without a mouse pad and the unit remains responsive. I’m very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend.See my pics for size reference and basic product details.",AmazonCustomer,"October 5, 2017"
5,"I don't really write that many reviews on Amazon. I just don't have the time, which is unfair bc I base every purchase on the reviews people have created the time to assist others with their purchases. I was at a meeting last week and noticed all my coworkers have stopped using traditional corded mice and started using the wireless ones. I found this mouse had great reviews and nice color options. It came in yesterday and BLEW AWAY MY EXPECTATIONS. The click feels so good, I know that sounds weird but not too hard or not too soft. Everything is ergonomic. I am so happy with this purchase.",DJW,"March 13, 2017"
1,"Update 9/21/17: After initially leaving positive feedback for this product, I feel obliged to update my initial review. I advise you not to buy the mouse if you are looking for one that lasts longer than a week. The mouse just doesn't work smoothly overall (read: it is not what you are looking for); the interruption when moving across the screen is so great that the mouse is simply useless (I attempted to solve the issues in various ways - from changing the battery to cleaning the mouse to trying to use it on different (types of) surfaces - without luck).",KM,"September 16, 2017"
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. i know it's cheap, i know it comes in great colors, but honestly just save your money. all of the positive reviews are from people who evaluated this thing right out of the box. i probably would have said the same thing as most of them. it's lightweight, slides around well, fairly durable. but after just 3 months of using it just 3 days a week, it crapped the bed. it still turns on, the sensor light flashes, clickers work, etc, but it seems to have lost connection with the USB so my computer won't pick it up, rendering it useless. no reason. i didn't drop it or fiddle with it. i've tried changing the batteries out to no avail. if i'd have known i would have just paid more for a better mouse, since that's economically what i'm ending up doing anyway.don't be me! learn from my mistake. live your best life with your best mouse (which i assure you, is not this mouse).",chelizabeth,"December 15, 2017"
3,"Lightweight and streamline, the click is barely audible but registers through my fingertip which I adapted to right away. Fits comfortably in my slightly small hand. The battery cover fits firmly but there is a long slot which makes it easy to remove. Great little mouse, and pretty too.UPDATE: After 3 months of daily use, the ball started squeaking and losing responsiveness. After 3 and a half months I needed to replace it. I will keep it as a back-up, but it is not responsive enough for daily use.",Lawren Freebody,"July 26, 2017"
5,"So far so good! I'll let you know if there is any changes. Just as described there is a silent click (no sound) works great and feels good!Update: I have since ordered another one because I loved the first one so much! This mouse has a great range and an excellence ""silent"" click, above all a wonderful feel! This is perfect for anyone in the home office a student going to college or just for personal use at home I would highly recommend!",Gabriel Martinez,"October 19, 2016"

   I really like that it was easy to set up with my laptop.  The colors are great, and its very quiet.  I got  because my baby can hear a pin drop and she doesn't wake up when I click. it sometimes need an easy shake when in sleep mode but I don't think that's as issue. you'll know when it needs a new battery. it takes one AA battery. I didn't show the lil piece that plugs into the computer but its small and stays on the side of your computer in the USB outlet",Melissa Teller,"March 17, 2020"
1,"This mouse didn’t even last me two full days. It stopped working by the second day. I changed the batteries to new ones three times and tried it on different laptops, and it would work for 5 seconds but then start lagging right away until it became unresponsive. I suspect the problem came from the USB Receiver. The light on the mouse stayed on the entire time it was unresponsive, which means the mouse worked, but the connection to the USB didn’t. So that pretty much renders it useless. It’s a shame because it was really cute and lightweight. It was quiet, too. But you’re better off buying an “uglier” Logitech mouse that will actually last you a few years. Oh well, you win some you lose some.",Velvet Thunder,"March 29, 2019"

   What do I love about this mouse? First of all the price, of course! What good stuff can one possibly expect for ten bucks? Right!But this little mouse is awesome! It feels great in my palm, it clicks very softly and easily, it is quiet, it is tracking fast and precisely. And it looks good in black and gold, very elegant and ""design"". I am glad I gave it a chance. It works perfectly like a good mouse should, for normal usage.That is all one can expect! I recommend it!If you like my review, thanks for letting me know!UPDATE on May 6, 2018There is one strange effect on this mouse, which at first was not happening: The pointer just ""slides"" down the screen and disappears on the bottom. And the even stranger thing is that it does that only when I let go of the mouse itself. It also does not do this all the time, but I'd say, about half the time. I wonder if there is a way to fix this, but have not found one yet. If the seller reads this, maybe they can comment?Apart from this slightly annoying behavior, I am still happy with this device.Hope this update was helpful. See video clip to demonstrate....UPDATE  # 2:The sliding effect: If my lap support (on which I sit my laptop) is somewhat inclined on my thighs, it causes the pointer to slide down the screen, because the mouse slides down the pad, lol. Case solved (see above).Today, on July 18 2018, the battery of the mouse was empty. It takes one AA battery. I used it every day intensively. So we can say that a battery lasts for exactly three months. You  will know when it is failing when the mouse gets very sluggish and stops responding momentarily, then picks up again, and shortly after, fails to move again. Time to change the battery!Other than that, I am still happy with this mouse. It works like on day One.UPDATE November 4, 2018:  DOWNGRADE FROM 5 STAR to 2 STARHalf the mouse is dead as of this morning. The right button does not react any longer to anything.This is a little strange, because it is the less often used button.I have no idea (yet) if there is still a warranty on this mouse. If there is, I'll contact the seller and see what can be done.Final update will be after contact.",Velvet,"April 25, 2018"
5,"I was looking for a light weight, low profile mouse to toss in my backpack and take along when I travel. I've used the mouse on three different computers (Windows 10, Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux) and it works very well. Tracks over multiple surfaces and is plug and play easy to use. What's not to like at this price and functionality>",Prentice,"July 5, 2016"
1,"I got this product about a year ago but I never decided to put a review until now. After buying it, it worked great but after a couple of months, it just stopped working. I've changed the battery, cleaned the mouse, cleaned the USB, I've done everything possible but it just doesn't work. The mouse turns on and my computer continuously searches for it but the mouse doesn't seem to be connected to the USB. The mouse is super cheaps so I guess I got what I paid for...",JJ,"February 15, 2019"
1,"EDIT 2/20/19:Completely stopped working. Wow, so disappointed. Never buying from this seller again.At first, I was pleasantly surprised by this mouse. I really wanted to invest in an expensive one but saw this one for $10 and decided to try it. I wanted my mouse to look sleek and match my space grey macbook so bought this mouse in space grey and was actually pretty happy with it when I opened the box. It goes well with my setup aesthetically and I had no issues connecting it and even liked how to ""clicking"" felt (if that makes sense). It didn't feel like ultra cheap plastic which is what I fully expected.BUT...after using it for several hours, I find the mouse turns itself off on its own. When I first noticed it happening, I thought my batteries were bad so I popped in new ones but it kept happening. I would be working on my computer and all of a sudden the mouse would stop working, and when I lifted it to check the bottom switch to see if it was still ""ON"", the switch was ""ON"" but the red light that shows up when a mouse is turned on wasn't there. So I keep toggling the switch off and back on to get this work. It happens every half hour to hour, or so. Really annoying.",jjk0892,"February 7, 2019"
2,"This wireless mouse is nice. It feels good in the hand and it is light but not light enough to the point where it feels cheap. I have had no problem with the connection to the wireless receiver. I got this on black Friday and the battery is still going strong. granted its only been a month so its not really a test of its battery life. Like any other cheap wireless mouse it needs  batteries one AA to be exact. So, even if the battery life isn't great you shouldn't  break the bank buying batteries for the thing. I have clicked many mouse buttons in my day but this mouse has one of the quietest click sounds I have ever heard and I like it! I find it funny how I like loud keyboards but quiet mice clicks. Overall this mouse is good for the money and when this mouse dies ( hopefully in a long time) I'll look at getting another Jelly Comb.UPDATE:Unfortunately my mouse died. I thought it might've been the battery but nope the mouse is now dead and I have gone back to using my regular wired mouse. Shame. I really liked the product.",Max,"December 27, 2017"
1,"I simply do not understand how this Slim Mouse can be rated so high. The pointer behavior is extremely erratic. The pointer jumps from one area to another area in an application (e.g., Outlook, Firefox web browser) when you are only attempting to move from one sentence or item to the next or from one word to the next. There is also a lag effect which might be contributing to the erratic behavior. System: Windows 10 (all updates). I have a Logitech mouse that tracks flawlessly - it is also a 2.4GHz USB nano type receiver. The only issue - the Logi is bulky for travel purposes. So I looked for a slim mouse. Searched Amazon saw this one, rated 4.5 stars - can't go wrong with 10,000+ reviews, right? IT was a real disappointment! Returning it. I am grateful for the fact that Amazon makes the return process painless.",StPete,"November 8, 2019"

   I’ve owned it for 2 mos now. So far so good. Buttons are quiet. Bye bye to the loud clicking sounds!",J.R.,"October 13, 2019"
1,"I am changing my initial review because the sleep mode on this thing has become an extreme annoyance. If it is not constantly in use, it will fall asleep. I am going to get a different mouse. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOUSE TO ANYONE. To show you how annoying it is, I am leaving my original review below:I am really impressed with this mouse. it was extremely affordable and appears well made (I've dropped it 3 times - twice on a hard surface) and the battery didn't even get knocked loose. It moves smoothly and I like the way it clicks (sounds weird but I don't know how else to describe it). I know it doesn't matter, but it is also very cute and I've gotten compliments on its appearance. I'm hooked on this brand. I forgot to add: I do NOT like the ""fall asleep mode"" - I have used wireless mice everyday for a year and have never needed to change the battery. I seriously doubt that it needs to go to sleep. Half the time I can't figure out why the mouse isn't working - but then i realize it fell asleep. I'm sure I'll get used to it, but it's a pain. I hope they get rid of the feature.",dr weitl,"July 1, 2019"
5,"Perfect for the budget-conscious, no-frills user.  I'm not a gamer.  I use my computer for work, email and surfing the web.  When I saw the gazillion items that came up when I searched ""wireless mouse"", I just took a deep sigh. So many different shapes and colors and ""frills""(?)  I thought ""Listen, I just want a frickin wireless mouse that works, that isn't annoying.""  This little number is sleek, simplistically attractive, the wheel is great, the piece that plugs into the usb port is small enough where you can leave it in all the time and there's a great storage place in the mouse for it too. (which may be pretty standard for any wireless mouse, who  knows. I don't.) And it's CHEAP! This mouse is perfect for me and I'd recommend it to anyone. And I'd buy it again.",Patti-Cakes from Dayton,"September 29, 2016"
1,"There are so many choices on Amazon, and I bought a similar one, more stylist, but the cursor was just not smooth. So I research on some tech review site and this was one of the top 2, the other being a Logetich brand which is much bigger which meant not the best to travel with. This is a regular size but flat and nice in the hand. Love the price. I would give it a 6 star if I could.updated on 8/10/18, the left click became unresponsive today, 4 months + 3 days after I started using it. I tried uninstalling it, switching the left and eight pointer, switching the USB port and remain the same problem. I am very disappointed that it broke down after only 4 months of use. I think I am going to buy a Logetich afterall.",CMA,"April 7, 2018"
5,"have had no problems with this. Was worried about it working on a hard desk surface without a mouse pad, but tracks perfectly! very light, but comfortable in the hand. Also, it is almost dead silent with clicking, moving, and rolling of the ball which is good while in a quiet lecture class. I use it with my Surface Pro 3, and it's fantastic. I like how the USB fits right into the mouse itself. At first I thought they messed up and forgot to package the USB connector, but it is right next to where the battery goes!Do feel I should note that the ball scroller is not really a ball. It looks like it should go every-which-way but it does not. It only goes on track forwards and backwards. This is fine, but the look of it makes you think you can scroll in any direction and you cannot.",Colin J,"November 11, 2016"
5,"I am quite hard on my mice and purchased this to replace another wireless mouse that bit the dust.This works great.  It's very, very quiet.  It's so quiet it could definitely in a silent library without disturbing anyone.  Tracking is smooth.  It is accurate and fast and works well on a regular desktop with no mousepad.  It stays connected all the time and if it does go to sleep a quick click with one button and it is immediately awake and ready to go.  The white and silver color looks great with my Mac and there was zero setup beyond plugging it in and turning it on.  The only annoying thing is that it does take up a precious USB port, but it's worth it for ease of use.  You also can't beat the price!",Beth,"May 30, 2017"
4,"Broken after about 9 months of light use.  Quality is very poor.  Had difficulty tracking with an obvious lag time.  Acceptable for occasional travel use when in need of a mouse but I wouldn't put this at a work computer.  The tracking inconsistencies add a few seconds to each task you do slowly wasting your time.  Ultimately the left click button stopped working.  Mouse was never dropped or abused.  Also annoying is the fact that you have to click to wake it up.  Battery life is about 5 months.  This didnt even make it though 2 sets of batteries.Customer service contacted my twice via email through amazon offering a free replacement or a refund.  It is certainly rare to find a company willing to stand behind a product so strongly and even rarer to for a company to actively seek out the dissapointed customers to make things right.  Because of their policy, I will still consider a Jelly Comb product in the future.",penguindeity,"March 9, 2018"
3,"I'm a mouse connoisseur of sorts. When Logitech stopped making the M305 I nearly cried. Then I went on a buying spree trying to buy up as many used and new ones I could still find online. I still am. But it's time to find a new mouse. Unfortunately the replacement is not perfect. It is the Logitech M510. I was hoping this mouse would do the job. Ergonomically it is great. Unlike the Logitech mice, my right ring finger will not create divot/hole in the rubber material on the side of the mouse after extensive use because this has ribbed plastic instead. It also feels nice in the hand (very nice) and the buttons and scroll wheel feel nice and don't make a lot of noise. HOWEVER, I use my mice extensively for use with Photoshop, where precision is very important. The Jelly Comb 2.4G Slim Wireless Mouse is NOT precise. When you need to grab things at the pixel level they mouse jumps around too much. This would not be a good mouse for gaming or for use with Photoshop. Just saying. Sigh.",Johnny Blood,"December 2, 2018"
2,"My Jelly Comb gave out on me, it now skips and only works intermittently. I bought it 10/2017 and it's been giving me problems for the last couple of weeks. It hasn't lasted a year. Then when I contacted Jelly Comb, they told me to follow the following steps:""Dear friend,Thanks for your message, really sorry for the problem.Could you pls test the mouse on other computers if it works well?Could you pls unplug and replug the USB receiver?If you have already done, Could you help to restore the factory settings of the mouse to match a new connection?.Restore mouse setting:-Re-insert the usb receiver into the usb port of the computer-Remove the usb receiver from your computer and remove batteries-Press and hold the right button and middle button（scrolling wheel）on the mouse, install the batteries to the mouse and keep holding the buttons for three more seconds then release the buttonsPls don’t worry, we offer 1 year warranty for our products and will try our best to satisfy you well.Best RegardsGraceJelly Comb Customer Service Team.""I followed the instructions and responded to their e-mail to me. I never heard back.I tried it and the mouse still didn't work. I tried again and still broken and I got no response from Jelly Comb. So am I now stuck with a broken mouse after 8 months and well before the 12 month warranty expired? I would definitely not recommend purchasing. I checked the batteries and followed their repair suggestions. No go. It's cheap, lightweight, but doesn't last through the warrany period. Very disappointed!",Frannie,"October 21, 2017"
5,"I have to say I am actually quite pleased with this computer mouse despite my original doubts and here's why;First and foremost, I received this package on time just as I had expected to so I can definitely say this company is quite good with it's delivery statuses. Secondly, I love how slim and comfortable this mouse feels in my hand! It's not bulky or anything which I really enjoy. Third, it works great on pretty much any surface. The tracking on this jelly comb mouse is outstanding. I'm using my mouse on my rug right now without any issue which is quite interesting to me, but I won't dare complain about such a nice benefit. Lastly, the right mouse button is overall pretty quiet when it comes to clicking. The last mouse I had from a Dell company was bulky and loud, which was just annoying and uncomfortable. But this mouse is one I can see myself using for quite a while. I am happy to say I am enjoying my purchase and cannot wait to try more products from this company in the future.Thank you!EDIT:So, I actually lost the adapter for this mouse back in 2019 and have been using various different mouses since it’s disappearance. As of currently in March of 2021, I still have failed to find a mouse wonderful enough to replace this one. I definitely will be reordering!",Seraphina,"January 10, 2017"
4,"I like the colors of these mouses.  The click is very dull and soft, not loud or clicky or annoying.  The scroll wheel has gentle bumping as it rolls.  Grip texture along the bottom edges are a nice feature to hold with thumb and pinky.My only complaints are that these mouses are not compatible with the MacBook Pro that my wife has.  There are no full size USB ports on her MacBook, only the smaller USB-C ports.  So I would have to get an adapter for this mouse dongle to work.The second complaint is that the mouse goes to sleep after a certain amount of time.  This happens whether the mouse is idle or not.  It will go to sleep even when you're using it.  After a couple hours, it just stops working.  You can't shake the mouse on the mousepad to wake it up.  There is a physical switch on the bottom of the mouse you have to click off and back on again to wake it up, or you click the left or right mouse button to wake it up.",safadez,"April 12, 2020"

1,"I have never heard of sleep mode on a mouse.  There is this website called Amazon which sells AAA batteries by the dozens for like $2.  Instead i'm switching a switch every 5 minutes.The button has a sweet spot.  You think you're going to highlight a paragraph, nope, just part of it.  Then you send a horrible email.  You meant to say something nice and then get to the point, nope you just send the part about how they suck at every aspect of life.....you mean to say you're trying and I hope all is well, but no, the button on the mouse does not work so you're gonna remember that for life.Gotta love breakups.And it's not tiny either like the keywords are, this thing is a big mouse.  A nice mouse is about 2 fingers....this mouse is easily 3-4 finger, this might be a fist.",Leonard Paasch,"October 21, 2019"
3,"Ill start with the pros:1. I absolutely LOVE the quietness of the clicks. It is a comforting sound that isnt harsh like a lot of mice i have used. (I am not sure the proper plural term when it comes to a computer mouse)2. It is very sleek and matches my HP Spectre. (not useful, i know. but it makes me happy)3. It fits comfortably in my hand and has a soft touch, if that makes sense.The Cons:1. It randomly turns off and i have to constantly wiggle the switch on the bottom to get it to work again. That is very frustrating when it happens so often.2. The sensor is horrible. When i move the mouse around, the cursor will lag behind and then just jump accross the screen. Ill spend a good 5 or so seconds trying to get it to line up. This is VERY frustrating when I am working with dual monitors. Sometimes its hard to find the cursor because it jumps around so much.3. Due to the sensor issues and sleep mode, it isnt that great for multitasking, especially for an impatient person with ADHD. I feel like i spend more time trying to ""fix"" it than i do actually using it.I did buy a mouse pad today and it seems to be working a little better now. I will give it a few more days and update my review if it also helps the sleep mode.I will not be ordering this again or recomending it. I personally feel like there are far better options and this one has been more inconvenient than anything.",Amanda Ogden,"February 23, 2021"
4,"I am THE mouse killer. I love my wireless mice, but thanks to disability I knock them off my tiny desk and they go skittering across the floor. For most mice, the battery cover pops off, sometimes divesting itself of its battery. The housing cracks after a few times and I have to buy another mouse. I was trying to be careful NOT to kill this one, but of course the inevitable happened - and I felt like cheering because it didn't come apart when it hit the floor. Not the first time. Or the second time. Or the seventh time.It does tend to go to sleep mode quickly - however, I'm more than okay with that, because I forget to turn it off, or end up having to set it aside longer than I planned. The sleep detail should translate into longer battery life.The one con I've encountered is periodic freezing and lag time. However, since I've had the same issue (albeit to a lesser degree) with other mice and even other computers, I'm not sure how much is mouse and how much browser.",Twisterjester,"January 27, 2020"
2,"This mouse looks so amazing. I bought it for my home office that I hardly use. Unfortunately the tracking on it is sub par. I don’t like mousepads and most laser mice today don’t require them, sadly this one does. I tested it against a few other wireless mice (including a $9.99 Logitech wireless mouse) and this was the only one that had issues on my desk. Now keep in mind I’m not using this for gaming, just general productivity and navigating.  It’s not unusable, but it’s frustrating to the point that I have on occasion opted to use the trackpad on a laptop instead. It’s sad because the mouse looks so great, which is why I can’t bring myself to return or replace it. If I had to use it on a regular basis I would have to get something different.",Adroa,"September 5, 2019"
3,"I have bought two of these, this recent one seems to be of worse quality, sometimes it is ok, but most of the time the mouse causes the cursor to jump around all over the place. It is very difficult to be accurate while using it as it moves around. I will lightly move the mouse to click on a link etc and it will be way across the page clicking something else the next second. I have a brand new MacBook Pro, it makes it a very frustrating experience an I end up using my touchpad.",Gruntlife,"November 20, 2019"
3,"I purchased this slim mouse so it would would slip into my laptop sleeve with little bulk.  Here's my list of Pros and Cons:Pros:• Very, very quiet.  There is no clicking sound at all, just a muffled stutter sound.• It feels good in the hand• The responsiveness is good when moving it• The center track ball is pretty easy to use• The price point is attractiveCons:  I have one major annoyance and one minor annoyance with this mouse:• The minor annoyance is that the unit goes to sleep pretty easily, requiring me to ""wake it up"" by tapping it on the mouse pad or rotating it side-to-side.  I imagine this is a design feature intended to minimize battery drain, but I'd love to lengthen the time before it sleeps.  As it is now, it's not unusual that a period of typing in a document will result in a sleeping mouse.• The major annoyance relates to the right mouse button.  I have relatively small hands and a light touch on a mouse.  My fingers just don't weight that much, and I exert very little resting pressure on the buttons when my hand is on the mouse.  Even so, the right mouse button is so incredibly sensitive that just the resting of my middle finger on the button causes it to click ALL THE TIME.  I'm constantly having the right-mouse window come up on documents, websites, applications, etc and it's really getting annoying.  I've looked for ways to modify the sensitivity of the buttons, but all I can find are settings for things like number of lines advanced when using the wheel, pointer tracking, and other standard attributes.  I've gotten to the point that I'm having to keep my middle finger raised off of the right button completely to avoid the constant menu pop-ups, which is causing some hand strain.In the grand scheme of things, we're talking about a mouse here, not something critical or earth-shattering.  But this one design flaw (yes, I call it a flaw) has become a daily irritation, and I'm likely going to return the item.",melrowgo,"March 5, 2019"
4,"The mouse seems to have its own mind of its own. I'm not sure if I have a defective product or what. When it works it works beautifully. It barely makes a noise when you click, it's quick, it's comfortable and it's a pretty color. But it tends to stop working out of nowhere - and i'm not referring to when it get's put to ""sleep"" which is a cool feature to (I imagine) not waste battery power. I can't figure out why it just stops working but I often have to turn it off, pray, turn it back on, curse, walk away and then come back to it. It tends to work after that. I want to love it but I don't understand what's going on. I've changed batteries, I've changed mouse pads, I've changed everything. I don't understand why it tends to stop working from time to time.",Si Ristina,"October 15, 2019"
5,"I had a silent mouse break during my flight due to the luggage moving around. I needed a replacement mouse quick and I also needed it to be a silent mouse! This one fit the bill. It was cheap, silent and had pretty good reviews. I bought it crossing my fingers and I was not disappointed. It was pretty smooth. It is a pretty good mouse. The only downside to this mouse is that it does not have a side button, which is what I was used to. So sadly, if you need a side button, you'll have to do without. However, for what it is, it works very remarkably well. It has pretty good sensitivity and it has a low profile with a pretty good feel to it. I'd buy this again. The infrared is pretty good. The battery life remains to be seen. I can easily see this being used in gaming but I have not tried it yet. The responsiveness is pretty good.",W. Kwok,"May 4, 2019"
5,"This is a very sleek mouse. I bought it for my younger student to do online school from the laptop. My older child asked for one too because he liked it as well. It's very comfortable in the hand, glides very well and is very easy to use. This mouse does turn itself off, which is a very nice feature to save on batteries. When you go to use it, simply click on a button and it turns on. The only downfall is that this mouse does require something under it to use it. I haven't used a mouse pad in years for any of the mouses I have used; however, this mouse tends to ""stick"" if it's on a solid surface (like the old mouses used to). Luckily, it does work if you put it on a colored book or in my sons case, the inside of his school agenda book.",A,"September 14, 2020"
4,"When looking for a mouse for my new MacBook Air 2017, I wanted something similar to what Apple sells, but of course I was looking for a cheaper alternative. I had my mind set on a white and slim mouse. I purchased this one b/c it looked to best match what I was looking for given the options on Amazon. I do like the mouse. You can't hear the clicking that older mouses had, it isn't bulky, it's battery operated & the USB isn't big and obnoxious either. The only thing I'm not a fan of, which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is b/c the finger scroll button scrolls so slowly if you're not scrolling at a faster pace. For example, when I'm shopping online and looking at items I'll scroll down but it scrolls maybe about a millimeter or so. So you'll really have to scroll faster than you normally would to get it at a good pace.",Oscar,"September 1, 2017"
1,"Order *placed* April 10 - mouse completely nonfunctional by May 1st. This thing worked for less than 20 days. Just having it plugged in for about 15 days for my laptop and it stopped tracking on screen. Now the USB gives an error if you plug it in 'Driver not installed correctly' - why it needs to reinstall the driver I have no clue. Also, even before it quit it wouldn't register when my computer was turned on. I would have to turn it off and turn it back on every time I sat down. My logitech/microsoft mice never needed that. Highly annoying.",Penny,"May 2, 2018"
4,"I purchased this product as a replacement for my Logitech. I've been loyal to Logitech for numerous years and decided to give Jelly Comb a try after reading numerous positive reviews. It's worked well, and given the price tag I can't say very much. I do have a couple of complaints, however.The first is that, when I have the mouse plugged into my USB-A slot, it works very choppy and the mouse doesn't seem to operate consistently. However, I do have a Type A to Type C converter, and it works perfectly fine when using it that way. I don't find this optimal, however, as this is a laptop and I'd like to be able to keep the bluetooth receiver in the computer at all times instead of using a converter all the time.The second is the sleep mode, and perhaps I've been spoiled from Logitech. My previous mouse made it so you could shake it a few times and it would come out of sleep mode immediately -- very useful for situations when you had to walk away and come right back. The Jelly Comb mouse made it so you had to turn the power off and back on again to use. There are pros to this, but I'd just like to be able to take it out of sleep mode without having to flip the power.Other than that, the design is great. It's very small, easy for transport, and very convenient. Color scheme was nice too because it matched my computer, haha. Some people have complained of the mouse wheel squeaking and, having had this for only two weeks, I haven't encountered this yet.Overall, I do recommend this product despite the issues listed above.Edit: July 5th, 2019I will be retracting some that I wrote in the previous review: I stated that my complaint was that the mouse would not come out of sleep mode without turning it off and back on again. I discovered that pressing a button on the mouse would reactivate it. I will be upping my review to four stars.",Jane Q. Doe,"June 14, 2019"
5,"I love the design and sleekness! I actually bought it because of worsening carpal tunnel pain in my right hand/wrist. This mouse, along with a specific mouse pad that I bought at the same time, have actually made my carpal tunnel pain quite forgettable, in that I haven’t really felt enough pain to remember that I have it. I can’t even remember from the description if it is meant for this purpose I just know that the bulkier, but cute, mouse I was using was not helping my pain. So however this is working, I’m impressed and a believer and will not buy any other mouse in the for seeable future except for replacements of this product... see next paragraph.I have two of these. This was the second one I purchased because I dropped my beloved first one one too many times. The day I dropped it at work on a hard cement floor is the same day that I purchased this one. And actually the only thing that messed up in the first one after the horrible drop is that it no longer right clicks. Everything else works fine on the first one but I have to right click. And it getting broken is completely on me. I’ve been known to break all but 1 of my Lifeproof iPhone cases (within a few months of getting it put on my phone too), so let’s just go with I’m really clumsy. So the fact that my original Jelly Comb (gold trim) mouse made it as long as it did being dropped as many times as it was by me is pretty impressive. (By the way I’m not condoning dropping it or saying that it won’t break I just can only tell you what mine has been through.) Within an hour of realizing I had messed up the first one I purchased this adorable one and actually plan to purchase a few “back ups” given my klutzy history.",Shannon Brown,"May 3, 2020"
4,"I had to replace my portable mouse and was dying to see the high prices of many on the market. When I came across this one the price was perfect, but the awesome color combos were what sold me (yes - I'll pay a bit more for pretty... hey, if you've got to look at it all day every day may as well be beautiful, right). It's so light weight, and I love that it sleeps when not in use (you have to click it to wake it back up). And it's quite? Like, not that loud clicky mouse is a real issue, but this one was remarkably quiet, yet you could still feel when you clicked (unlike some ""quiet"" tech).I couldn't go full five stars because it does not feature a button to click back (either on the side or on the scroll ball on top) so you don't have to move the pointer up to the back button. It's a small thing, but when I got my first mouse that had this feature I thought I'd never use it, but ends up I use it a ton. So if this one had it, then it would be perfect. It doesn't, so I'll have to go with nearly perfect!",KL Thomas,"June 3, 2019"
2,"I've had this mouse for about four and a half months.  I JUUUUUST ordered a replacement mouse because this one started working differently this week, and I just can't deal with it for work.  It'd be fine (but annoying) at home playing around, but for important work at the office - can't handle it.  It's already made me delete stuff and move folders around where I can't find them.In any case - here's what started happening, abruptly I might add (and I changed batteries, so that's not it).  The left clicker, most important piece, isn't ""stuck"" but it's now become a touch pad.  It's the weirdest thing.  If my finger is resting on it, the same was as always, it now depresses the left button.  The only way to get it to stop is to literally lift my finger up off the mouse.  And I wasn't exaggerating about the acting like a touch pad - it's the FAINTEST touch that clicks it.  For some reason, it's made double clicking really difficult too.  I guess it's hard to get the timing down of a double click, when the click is already happening without you doing it, making it a triple click?Now I love the aesthetics, the silent clicking, but having the left clicker basically always depressed is just mucking stuff up all over my work.  So I can't deal with it, and frankly I shouldn't.  A mouse shouldn't stop working after four months, or change how it works.  As I'm writing this, it's made me decide to change my 3 star rating to a 2 star.  What good is a pretty mouse if it makes you send emails, delete files, and place orders just from hovering your mouse over it.",S. Hutton,"November 1, 2019"
5,"I downloaded Mojave on my Mac last week.  After that my wireless mouse would not allow me to double click to open files or documents (or anyt/hing). After hours of research and trying to resolve the problem I got to open file son desktop twice by double clicking. Other than that anything i wanted to open i had to right click and click on ""open"". This was doable but frustrating.  Plus it was even worse on Thunderbird. I could not open up my e mail files without right clicking and hitting open etc.  Contacted Mac/Apple and for 4 or 5 hours on day 1 (and 3 hours on day 2) they could not resolve the problem. Only thing they said i could do was back up my entire computer and remove Mojave. But was risking losing everything. Then someone suggested might be a Logitech problem (hang in there folks this ends soon) Logitech said try another Logitech mouse. Went on several help lines etc.  I then tried a wired moue and ...ta da !! my problem went away but I don't want to be tethered to my mouse when using my laptop on my lap.  So...tried this mouse. Just came today.  HOOORAY!!!!! problem is G O N E !!! I can now go back to working my computer the way i used to !! YEAH!! I have lost hours and hours of several days trying to resolve the problem....and this is it.  This mouse is quiet (no squeaking as one person said. Perhaps he/she should return it as this one is silent and even the right and left click is silent.  Nice to the palm and feels nice and movements are smooth.  For those who did not like it the onlything i can say is perhaps get a replacement as this one is perfect. Should something change I will come up and do an update but for right now this stoped so much frustration and even thoughts of getting a new computer.  I have a disability so the added aggravation was not welcome...but this mouse certainly is....  welcome !!!!!",A. Holloway,"October 31, 2018"
2,"I didn't know until after purchase that the sleep mode was so flawed.  When attempting to wake the mouse, I get accidental clicks which cause unacceptable results.  Going to the device manager and disabling power management for the input device is ineffective.I also don't like the mouse because it slips out of the hand like a hard-boiled egg.  There are ridges at the bottom but they are so low that the fingers never get a good grip.The mouse should be suitable for those who are ambidextrous.  However, the low-profile build results in the left hand always feeling cramped as it is trying to grip, move the mouse, and control the buttons.I wanted a simple business and non-gaming mouse.  I like the quiet click but the problems with the design are too much.  Time to search again.",PACSman,"May 14, 2021"
5,"Bought 3 of these looking for some basic wireless mice that won't break the bank if I lose them etc... it's perfect for packing up with a laptop if you travel a lot and are prone to losing wireless mice. It's NOT a high-quality item, but for $10 hopefully you're not expecting anything spectacular - it works.The Good: I tested it on a 2013 iMac and it was plug and play perfect. The iMac did request me to set up my 'keyboard' because I guess the same receivers are sent out with keyboards as well - I just closed that notification box and it never came up again. I also tested it on a Windows 10 laptop and it worked as advertised.The Bad: As expected - it's looks make it seem higher quality than it is - do not lose perspective that this is a $10 mouse. Doesn't come with a battery, but that's not uncommon at this price. The scroll wheel looks like a 360 degree ball in the pictures but don't be fooled - it's a wheel and only moves forward/backward. Neither of these are enough for me not to give it 5 stars considering the price point.The Whatever: depending on what you like, the click might be too quiet. It's a very quiet click to the point that you might think it's not working... but it's working.",Sharif J,"October 16, 2017"
3,"UPDATE -  I have been working with the customer support for this product and they have been very good. They’ve offered me replacement or refund, which ever I choose. They also have offered a solution that may have fixed the mice.  While I am not thrilled with the product itself, the customer support is good enough that I am adding some stars back.Original Review -I have worked in IT for over 20 years and never thought I would have to write a negative review about a mouse.  I bought two of these mice, One for my son and one for my wife to work from home during the pandemic. They worked for maybe two weeks. Sometimes the two mice get confused on which receiver they go to and mouse number one will start controlling computer number two.  Reinstalling the USB receivers will fix the problem for a little while but inevitably it returns.  They also don’t respond to clicks half the time. You have to hold the mouse button for up to a full second before the click registers.  Both of the mice had these same issues.  Tech-support was not very useful. They  just kept asking me for videos of the problems but of course their mail server would kick back the videos.  I am past the return window so  I’m stuck with mice that don’t work properly.  Go with logitech or Microsoft.",Jared D,"September 17, 2020"
4,"I could have bought any wireless mouse, but I bought this one because the receiver can be stored inside the unit, and it has a smart color combo that looks professional.  It's paired to an HP x360 Envy and seems to fit well.But it's light.  Like... feather light.  I'm used to a gaming mouse that weighs in the neighborhood of 100g or more.  This might weigh 30g.  But I do like the auto-off function.  Several times now, I totally forget to turn it off after use and I'm sure the battery thanks me for this feature.It's also a bit small for my hand compared to the gaming mouse I was used to.  But it's supposed to be small.  It's for portability and for a laptop.  I wouldn't recommend this as your desktop mouse.  And definitely not for gaming.  But it's a perfectly good mouse that has worked on all surfaces so far except a gray/black carpet top table.  But nobody uses that as a mousing surface.",Gregory M.,"August 19, 2020"
1,"Bought this mouse via Prime May 28 2019. In early January 2020 the center scroll rubber ""button"" on the mouse just stopped working. It will not budge forward or backward; it simply will not work. I did try to ""unstick"" it but when I did, it still did not work. It went right back to being stuck and immovable.Up to now, I've liked the mouse, but really in the long run it's simply not worth it to pay for a mouse that will break after only SEVEN months usage. The right and left buttons still work but have you tried using a mouse without the scroll function? Yeah, not something one wants to do these days.Sorry, cannot recommend this Jelly Comb mouse. It looks nice, it has a sleek design, but it needs to be functional for more than seven months.",Lady Day,"January 31, 2020"
